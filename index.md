<p>In my limited 2 years invested in the hobby of putting fountain pen ink to paper, I've seen the question, "What ink/pen can I use on really cheap office paper?" or some varaiation of that, many times. This blog will be a sort of testing ground for that, using my modest collection of ink and cheap paper. I'm going to look at quite a few paper types, write some passages of public domain books as writing samples, and see how they do. </p>
<p>This is not a pen, paper, or ink review blog. There are plenty of those available that have been around for years and will tell you everything you might want to know about that particular pen, paper, or ink. I'll be using various inks with various pens. Most of my pens have fine nibs, but sometimes I'll use a medium. I'll do a brief highlight of the pen I'm using, but this blog will be focusing on performance of the ink on paper and less about the pen's performance.</p>
<p>The testing will be the same for every ink. I'll look at bleedthrough, ghosting, and feathering as well as how feasible it is to write on both sides. I'll throw in a yellow steno pad and post-it-notes for color variation. I'm hoping these types of evaluations will be useful for someone in the future. I'm looking forward to the testing.</p>
